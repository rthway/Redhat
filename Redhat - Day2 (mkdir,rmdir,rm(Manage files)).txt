mkdir -m a=rwx abcd       --- create directory abcd with permission of read,write and execute

mkdir -p /home/prtm/x/y/z -- Creates the directory /home/prtm/x/y/z. If the parent directory /home/prtm/x/y does not already exist, mkdir will create that directory first.

=================================================================================================
rmdir  remove directory,to remove directory

rmdir [directory_name]

rmdir abcd 		removes the directory abcd (if exist)
rmdir abcd{1..20}	removes the directory abcd1,abcd2,..abcd20 (if exist) 
rmdir -v abcd{1..20}	(details about progress in terminal),removes the directory abcd1,abcd2,..abcd20 (if exist) 

directory cann't be deleted if having data inside it,(it is not possible)
To do that we will need to remove inside data first
==================================================================================================
rm	remove command to remove both files and directory

rm doesn't delete a directory until we give it a command option -rf
loop through directory till it delete all data and then empty directory or directories will be removed at last
In copy process first directory will created and then files will be copied


rm -rvf abcd   - remove the directory,background process shown done forcefully
rm file.txt   - to remove file whether it contains data or not

Creating File:

The touch command allows us to update the timestamps on existing files and directories as well as creating new, empty files.

The easiest and most memorable way to create new, empty files is by using the touch command.
To create a new file simply run the touch command followed by the name of file you want to create:

touch file1.txt
If the file file1.txt doesnâ€™t exist the command above will create it, otherwise, it will change its timestamps.

To create multiple files at once, specify the file names separated by space:

$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
