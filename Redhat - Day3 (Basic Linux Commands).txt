// Reading the content of file

Less and more-

Everything in Linux is file.Sometime you may find its very hard to read the entire file.To navigate in the file Linux provide some cool commands.

command			 Description
more /var/log/messages --you can scroll through the text of a file

less /var/log/messages --you can scroll in both directions.Use page up and page down keys to scroll

press q anytime to quit from the output of the commands

Let take a example for search
Now I would search the term pid_max in forward direction

/pid_max -- for forward search pid_max
?pid_max -- for reverse search pid_max

Cool Feature of Less command--
it can read Gzip format compression file without uncompressing them.

less /usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz

====================================================
Tail command

but you can change it with -n switch. For example to see the 3 line use

tail -3 /var/log/messages

tail -n 3 /var/log/messages --same as previous command

=================================================================
Head command
