It is very common to forget the path of file during the exam.

find

find [location ] -name [file name]

find :-command
location :-where you want to search the file
-name :- option to specify the file name
file name :-name of file which you want to search

find / -name vsftpd.conf

this would start search from top level root directory and list the found.

It is time consuming process.Use subdirectories whenever you know it.

find /etc -name vs*.conf

*   Any number of alphanumeric characters
?   Single alphanumeric characters



-----------------------------------------------

problem with multiple file found using wildcard?

e.g.

touch file1.conf
touch demo.conf
touch fileK.conf

Find the files those start from f and end with conf

error it gives
find:paths must precede expression

if you type
find /root/pratice_of_find  -name  f*.conf
find:paths must expression: fileK.conf

It is due to multiple files found,because what find parsing in this case will look like
find /root/pratice_of_find  -name file1.conf filek.conf

solution,would stop the shell(bash) expanding your wildcards
put the f*.conf in quotes
find /root/pratice_of_find  -name  "f*.conf"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Locate command
find command is too time consuming specially in 2 hour RHCE exam.use locate command instead of find in exam.
locate command use a database of installed files and directories.locate command database updated only once in a DAY.

locate [file name]

locate vsftpd.conf

Major drawback of locate command is that it update its database only once in a day.
database of locate command is updated from /etc/cron.daily/mlocate.cron script.We can manually run this script
/etc/cron.daily/mlocate.cron

In exam
Update locate command database as soon as possible and use locate command whenever you need to search any file.
Use find command when locate doesn't works.Try to specific as much path as you remember when using find command.
